Overview

This project simulates an AI agent operating inside an enterprise productivity environment (Microsoft 365 Copilot–like experience).
The agent assists sales teams by incrementally gathering context, maintaining proposal state across sessions, and generating enterprise-ready sales proposals with mandatory human approval.

The focus of this prototype is agent behavior, reasoning, and workflow orchestration, not production-grade integrations.
